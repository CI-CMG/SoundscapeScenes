# Ocean Sound
Ocean sound refers to the collection of acoustic energy present in marine environments, encompassing a variety of sources, including sounds from marine animals, geophysical noise from waves, wind, rain, and human generated noise from shipping, sonar, and offshore construction. Monitoring ocean sound provides key insight to understanding ecosystem dynamics, detecting environmental changes, and managing the impacts of noise pollution on marine organisms. Learn more at [Discovery of Sound in the Sea](https://dosits.org/)

**Why do we care?** Ocean sound is critical for the survival of many marine animals because it is a primary means of communication, orientation and navigation, finding food, avoiding predators, and choosing mates. As such, human activities that produce underwater sounds have the potential to negatively impact animals by reducing their ability to hear prey, predators, and each other.  

National marine sanctuaries are home to many acoustically active marine animals and understanding the presence and impacts of noise is a conservation priority. Further, the occurrence and types of sounds present offer key insights on animal presence, species behaviors, human-use patterns, and changing ocean conditions. 

# When, where, and why are we listening?

NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries maintains a nationally coordinated underwater sound monitoring network across the National Marine Sanctuary System, known as ONMS Sound. ONMS works with partners to monitor [sound within national marine sanctuaries](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/science/monitoring/sound/) off the US East Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, off the West Coast and in the Pacific Islands region. Ocean Sound monitoring sites are located in strategic locations within sanctuary boundaries and records continuously. Audio recordings and standardized sound measurements are available through the  NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information’s Passive Acoustic Archive. Explore the monitoring sites [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/).

The `r params$author` is one of the largest marine protected areas in the United States, spanning over 6,094 square miles along the central California coast. It is home to a rich diversity of marine life, including whales, sea otters, seabirds, and vast kelp forests. MBNMS supports these ecosystems, promotes marine research, and offers many ocean-based recreational opportunities like diving, fishing, and whale watching. 

**Ocean sound monitoring** supported by ONMS began in 2019, however, a long history of underwater acoustic monitoring has occurred in this sanctuary[1](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/arlo/article/3/2/65/123823/Ocean-ambient-sound-Comparing-the-1960s-with-the). Further, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute supports a continuous real-time monitoring effort within the sanctuary that began in 2015, known as the  [Soundscape Listening Room](https://www.mbari.org/project/soundscape-listening-room/). Collectively, these underwater sound monitoring efforts have provided key insight on [cryptic species](https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-024-00500-x) ,  [whale migration patterns and drivers](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.14013),  [methods for detecting fish sounds](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/153/3/1710/2881267) , and the [steady rise in ocean noise levels](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/arlo/article/3/2/65/123823/Ocean-ambient-sound-Comparing-the-1960s-with-the), to highlight a few

**Current soundscape monitoring** is maintained at four sites within MBNMS. Two sites (MB03, MBAR_MARS) are located further offshore, capturing patterns in migrating whales and transiting commercial vessel traffic. The two other sites (MB01, MB02) are located more inshore, capturing more local vessel activity and sounds from nearshore species.
