# **What is ocean sound?**

Ocean sound refers to the collection of acoustic energy present in marine environments, encompassing a variety of sources, including sounds from marine animals, geophysical noise from waves, wind, rain, and human generated noise from shipping, sonar, and offshore construction. This collection of sound at a given place and time is often called a soundscape. Monitoring ocean soundscapes provides key insight to understanding ecosystem dynamics, detecting environmental changes, and managing the impacts of noise pollution on marine organisms. Learn more about ocean sounds at [Discovery of Sound in the Sea](https://dosits.org/).

**Why do we care?** Ocean sound is critical for the survival of many marine animals because it is a primary means of communication, orientation and navigation, finding food, avoiding predators, and choosing mates. As such, human activities that produce underwater sounds have the potential to negatively impact animals by reducing their ability to hear prey, predators, and each other. **US National marine sanctuaries** are home to many acoustically active marine animals and understanding the presence and impacts of noise is a conservation priority. Further, the occurrence and types of sounds present offer key insights on animal presence, species behaviors, human-use patterns, and changing ocean conditions.

# **When, where, & why are we listening?**

NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) maintains a nationally coordinated underwater sound monitoring network across the National Marine Sanctuary System, known as [ONMS Sound](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/science/monitoring/sound/). ONMS sound works with partners to monitor off the US East Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, off the West Coast and in the Pacific Islands region. Ocean Sound monitoring sites are located in strategic locations within sanctuary boundaries and records continuously. Audio recordings and standardized sound measurements are available through the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information's Passive Acoustic Archive. Explore the acoustic monitoring sites [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/).

The **`r params$author`** is one of the largest marine protected areas in the United States, spanning over 6,094 square miles along the central California coast. It is home to a rich diversity of marine life, including whales, sea otters, seabirds, and vast kelp forests. MBNMS supports these ecosystems, promotes marine research, and offers many ocean-based recreational opportunities like diving, fishing, and whale watching.

**Ocean sound monitoring** coordinated by ONMS began in 2019, however, a long history of underwater acoustic monitoring has occurred in this sanctuary [[1](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/arlo/article/3/2/65/123823/Ocean-ambient-sound-Comparing-the-1960s-with-the)]. Further, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute supports a continuous real-time monitoring effort within the sanctuary that began in 2015, known as the [Soundscape Listening Room](https://www.mbari.org/project/soundscape-listening-room/). Collectively, these underwater sound monitoring efforts have provided key insight on [cryptic species](https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-024-00500-x) , [whale migration patterns and drivers](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.14013), [methods for detecting fish sounds](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/153/3/1710/2881267) , and the [steady rise in ocean noise levels](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/arlo/article/3/2/65/123823/Ocean-ambient-sound-Comparing-the-1960s-with-the), to highlight a few.

**Current ocean sound monitoring and analysis** is maintained at four sites within MBNMS. Two sites (MB01, MB02) are located more inshore, capturing more local vessel activity and sounds from nearshore species. The two offshore sites (MB03, MBARI_MARS) capture patterns in migrating whales and transiting commercial vessel traffic.

# **What sounds contribute to the soundscape?**

Soundscape data are complex -- representing all the types of sounds present at a given time and location and influenced by the weather. The purpose of the figure below is to show the contributions to a soundscape: colored lines represent seasonal differences, vertical lines indicate representative frequencies for different sound sources, and the dashed gray lines bound the soundscape to expected range when only wind noise is present.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap=paste("**A visualization of ocean sound in", params$sitetyp, "habitat**. Seasonal summary of measured sound levels (colored lines) shown as median hourly values over all available data. Vertical lines indicate representative frequencies for different sound sources: ship noise (63, 125 Hz), fin whales (20 Hz), blue whales (45 Hz), and humpback whales (500 Hz). The bottom bar shows how the data are distributed in the different wind categories: low < 5 m/s, med 5-10 m/s, high >10 m/s. Dotted lines are modeled wind noise at this depth based on [Hildebrand et al 2021](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/149/6/4516/1059383&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1739833923518127&usg=AOvVaw24yaJ1b4fPnOnoYFke3nuD)." )}

How was this calculated?

<dialog id="infoModal">

<p>The median power spectral densities (PSD) for all hours across all years are calculated from calibrated audio data using community software tools: <a href="https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton/tree/master" target="_blank">Triton Soundscape Metrics</a>, <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jel/article/1/1/011203/219719" target="_blank">MANTA</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/lifewatch/pypam" target="_blank">PyPAM</a>. Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PAMscapes/index.html" target="_blank">PAMscapes</a> was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).</p>

# **What are we learning?**

**Nearshore fish chorus activity**. One of the monitoring sites in Monterey Bay (mb01) is known as a hotspot for fish choruses and a monitoring priority was to understand when fish are acoustically active. A dedicated analysis of the patterns in fish chores was completed to provide initial insight on daily patterns and annual trends. Analysis included data from 2019-2023.

<button onclick="alert(&#39;The seasonal distribution of fish chorusing was calculated as the hours for each week in the year. There were some data gaps between recordings, as seen in the available data histogram of total recording hours for each week of the year. Daily patterns in fish chorusing was calculated as the combined proportion of fish chorusing for each hour in the day (Pacific Standard Time) calculated by computing total days when fish sang during a certain hour / total days spent recording during that hour at MB01. Current trends in fish chorusing is calculated a total fish chorusing / total recording hours for each month between January of 2019 and December of 2021 (the proportion of chorusing). Dots plotted for each month represent the proportion of chorusing from the most recent year of data. Fish species: Bocaccio (blue), Plainfin Midshipman (orange), White Seabass (red), UF440 (purple), and UF310 (green) were identified at MB01 between November 2018 and August 2023. Grey dots indicate that month of recent data was from 2022, black dots indicate that month of recent data was from 2023, and empty dots indicate off effort (no data).&#39;)">
