# 1) Label and Integrate 1-min hybrid-milli-decade data with event based detections
# eg. bio_species Code

# Event detections: detection periods with start and end time

# 2) Label into specific predefined acoustic scene categories
# low-frequency- frequency range 100- 500 Hz (Kait is 500 Hz, so limiting, why not 1 or 2 kHz)
# bio is very generic
# bio + anthro
# anthro
# unknown?

# 3) Label with context variables: ice (1-4), wind (1 or 2), AIS  (bring in once acoustic scene analysis)
# this is a generic need in community- is labeling data- wind and event-based detections?
# axiom help with data integration- no just visualization + data products
# show example of wind and what I needed do to get to this
